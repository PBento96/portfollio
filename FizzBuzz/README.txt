Why FizzBuzz?
    I was inspired to make this after rewatching Tom Scott's video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPZ0pIK_wsc&t=300s).
    I wanted to make a version that let you define all the variables and was able to handle wrong inputs.

What is FizzBuzz?
    FizzBuzz is a game where you have to count up replacing multiples of 3 with the word Fizz and Multiples o 5 with the word buzz.
    Multiples of both get replaced with FizzBuzz! This program lets you define your own start and end point as well as define you own Fizz and Buzz!
